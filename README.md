# WEATHER APP 0.1 READ ME
This Python code creates a simple weather application using Tkinter GUI library. It fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on user input for a city name. 
The application displays the current temperature and weather description along with an image representing the weather condition. 
Users can input a city name, click on "APPLY" button to get weather information displayed on the interface. 
The application also provides a visual representation of the weather condition using different images and colors.

Please enter name of city or country in english. Otherwise openweather database maybe could not find that place.
